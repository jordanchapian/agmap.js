 Instance based data structure that will aggregate data at different granularities (the programmer may supply any number of granularities, and any granularity they like.) It will also handle all expiration, caching, and heap storage. Also, the programmer has the ability to subscribe to certain events like: some key has expired, or some aggregation function has been executed. Later on I might add some facilities to hook it up to something like mongo for heap storage, but for now, the heap is just a hash table of arrays. This is meant to handle constant streams of data, supplying customizable generalizations at customizable levels. It will function seamlessly on both the client and the server *node.js, which was the main motivation for building this.
